# Balkan Sports Store eCommerce prototype app made with Angular 🏀

Balkan Sports Store is a web app that lets you browse and buy sports products, such as basketballs, jerseys, shoes, etc. You can also manage the products and orders as an admin. This app is a prototype of an eCommerce platform that showcases the power and flexibility of Angular.

## What is Angular?

Angular is a popular framework for building dynamic web applications. It uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static types and other features. Angular helps you create responsive and modular web apps with components, directives, services, pipes, forms, routing, and more.

## How this app was inspired by a book

This project was inspired by the book [Pro Angular 6](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484236482) by Adam Freeman, which covers the essential features of Angular and how to use them to create professional web apps. I followed the book's examples and exercises to learn Angular and then applied my own ideas and design to create Balkan Sports Store.

## Tech stack

The app is built with the following technologies:
