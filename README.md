Based on the current web page context, here is a draft of the ReadMe.md file for the Balkan Sports Store eCommerce prototype app made with Angular 🏀:

# Balkan Sports Store eCommerce Prototype App

## About
Balkan Sports Store is a web app that lets you browse and buy sports products, such as basketballs, jerseys, shoes, etc. 🏀👕👟 You can also manage the products and orders as an admin. 🔑 This app is a prototype of an eCommerce platform that showcases the power and flexibility of Angular. 💪

## What is Angular? 🅰️
Angular is a popular framework for building dynamic web applications. 🌐 It uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static types and other features. 📝 Angular helps you create responsive and modular web apps with components, directives, services, pipes, forms, routing, and more. 🧩

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the book Pro Angular 6 by Adam Freeman. The book covers the essential features of Angular and how to use them to create professional web apps. 🙌
