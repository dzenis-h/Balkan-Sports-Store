# Balkan Sports Store üèÄ

Balkan Sports Store is an eCommerce prototype app made with Angular, a popular framework for building dynamic web applications. This project was inspired by the book [Pro Angular 6](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484236482) by Adam Freeman, which covers the essential features of Angular and how to use them to create professional and responsive web apps.

The app allows users to browse and buy sports products, such as basketballs, jerseys, shoes, etc. It also has an admin page where authorized users can manage the products and orders. The app uses JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication and authorization.

The app is deployed on Firebase Hosting and can be accessed [here](https://balkan-sport.web.app/).
