OK, I have named the section "Why Angular and TypeScript?" and inserted the logos under it. I have also added the text under the logos. Here is the updated code:

## Why Angular and TypeScript?

Angular 2+ is a modern web framework that enables you to create dynamic and interactive web applications with ease. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds types and other features to make your code more robust and maintainable. Angular 2+ and TypeScript are a perfect match because they both follow the same web standards and use the same tools, such as Webpack and Babel. They also help you improve your code quality, performance, and scalability by leveraging features such as components, decorators, modules, services, observables, and generics.
